## ex02 - Test my_strdup

Yet again another boring test to write.

For this third one, write one tests in
`tests/strdup.c` for the `my_strdup` function (`src/strdup.c`).

For the test just check the content of the returned value. You may check that
the returned value is not `NULL`.
Do not forget to release the allocated ressource by `strdup()` in your test.

Once your test is ready run
```bash
make test_run
```
