## ex01 - Test my_strcpy

For this second task you need to write two tests in `tests/strcpy.c` for the
`my_strcpy` function (`src/strcpy.c`).
Write two tests:

- One which copies a non empty string into `dest`
- A second one which copies an empty string into `dest`

For each of this test check the returned value with the correct
[assertion](https://criterion.readthedocs.io/en/master/assert.html#common-assertions).

Once your tests are ready run
```bash
make test_run
```
